# Piano-Score-Difficulty-datasets
The original score files are stored in the form of MIDI, and the score files of the same difficulty level are stored in the same folder, and the score files of all difficulty levels are stored in a main folder “data”. The two datasets were collected from the websits 8notes and ambambrosepianotabs, named EN and AMBPT datasets respectively.
